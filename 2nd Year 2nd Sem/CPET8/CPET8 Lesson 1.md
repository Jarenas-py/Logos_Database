CPET8 Lesson 1

BASIC DEFINITIONS

Software
- Group of instructions that does a function upon execution.
- It is how the program talks with the hardware of a system unit in order to function properly.
- Computer programs or software products that may be developed for two types of end-users: a. General- refer to the general market and b. Bespoke- developed for a single customer with specific needs in the software to be developed.

Software Engineering
- refers to the concepts and techniques employed for software development to complete the production of a software product within deadline and budget.
- Most economies rely on software as most production are managed by it. Because of this, a significant financial investment is seen in most country's GNP (Gross National Product) with regards to software development and engineering.

Software Engineering vs. Computer Science
- Computer Science deals with the theoretical aspects of software design while software engineering is more defined in which it deals with the practicalities of software development.
- Computer Science deals with the intricacies of the subject matter, software engineering deals with formulating software based on the current capabilities of modern hardware.

Programs vs Software Products
- Programs are usually small in size, fulfilling a specific function for one to few end-user while software products are usually utilized by large number of end-users. Particularly by a business or company.
- Programs lack proper documentation while software products do.
- Just think in general that programs are amateur applications that lack many of the professionalism because it aims for only functionality while software products include most formalities since it will be used by a formal business of company for various tasks.

Software Programming
- Refers to developers who create programs.

Software Engineers
- Refers to developers who create Software Products. 

EVOLUTION OF SOFTWARE INDUSTRY
1. Independent Programming Services (Era 1)
- Software was made for embedded systems in the hardwares of specific targmet markets. In Feb. 1995, The Computer Usage Company (CUC) was created for this service alone. 
- Other software were created for specific use in a hardware. The Semi-Automatic Ground Environment (SAGE) was the first software designed for the US Air Force for air defense (1949-1962). The Semi-Automated Business Research Environment (SABRE) was another early software designed airline ticket bookings.
 
2. Software Products (Era 2)
- Martin Goetz created "Autoflow" in 1964 for the Radio Corporation of America (RCA) which payed them to create a Flowchart software which was ultimately rejected by the company.
- The formulation of software products for businesses started in this era.

3. Enterprise Solutions (Era 3)
- The Systems, Application and Products (SAP) was created  by Dietmar Hopp. which was commissioned by IBM Germany in 1997 for 3.3 Billion USD. 
- This marked the start of software products for large business enterprises.

4. Packaged Software for the Masses (Era 4)
- VisiCalc. a spreadsheet program was released for the masses.
- Microsoft created an OS for IBM personal computers.

5. Internet Software and Services (Era 5)
- 1994, internet.

PROBLEMS IN SOFTWARE ENGINEERING AND SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT

Software Costs and Problems in Software Engineering
- Software is more expensive than system costs especially when software that is developed is aimed to be maintained for a long time.
- 60% development costs, 40% maintenance costs. 
- According to a 1995 report from an IT Company (Standish Group), most software development projects in the US are finished within schedule (16%), 31% are cancelled before completion, and 53% are completed after set deadline. 
- The complexity of software, lack of software engineer training, accidents, software myths and more are the causes of most software development projects to be cancelled or done after the set deadline. 

Software Myths (Customer's POV)
- A general statement of the program is sufficient and specific requirements are not needed to be described to the developer as these will be filled in.

Software Myths (Developer's POV)
- Once software is presented, the job is done and no maintenance and debugging is further needed.
- As long as maganda company, no need to be concerned sa code. This also states if the company has the state of the art stuff. (Developers should always test and debug their code in their own ways as well).

Key Challenges in Software Engineering
- Creating software with legacy systems in mind.
- Different mix of hardwares and OSs
- Increased deadlines because people want it fast (damn).
- Organizations in software development go with what has worked in the past.
- Out of date practices are solidified in today's software engineering and development.
- Software changes and development happen very fast (from simple batch to multiprogramminng, to internet as well as Moore's Law, and very fast market pace) and because of that, the lack of education and training for software engineers can result to them na napagiiwanan. 

SOLUTIONS FOR SOFTWARE ENGINEERING PROBLEMS

Software Process
- Refers to the step-by-step activities involved in producing a software to the end-user. These activities are the following:
a. Specification- identification of software requirements and limitations
b. Development- actual coding of the software.
c. Validation- Checking if the software created aligns with the end-user's means.
d. Evolution- Updating software depending on end-user's future means or other external factors that may warrant changes (hardware constraints, etc.)

Software Process Models
- Refers to different models, frameworks, or guides that a software engineer may utilize as a guide for how activities should be done in a sequential manner when conducting software development.
- Ano ba ung mga activities na need gawin? Ano pagkakasunod-sunod ba dapat? How should they be implemented properly? These frameworks can serve as a guide to software engineers as to what next to do when developing software.

Computer-Aided Software Engineering
- These are application softwares that help a software engineer on specific software process activities. For example, a software process in determining the features of a program to be developed (flow charting) is determined by the developer. To simplify the process, a CASE program called Microsoft Visio which helps digitalize and makes the process of making flow charts easier can help that aforementioned user.
- There are different types of CASE according to their versatility and intended utilization:

a. Upper CASE- CASE application softwares that assists in the early activities in the software processes (flow charting, and software requirements and needs).
b. Lower CASE- CASE Application softwares that assists in the actual coding and development of the software (IDEs, debbuger, and compilers).

Attributes of a Good Software:
- a software should be maintainable, dependable, efficient and usable. They should always deliver the required requirements as requested by the user.

Professional and Ethical Responsibility
- Software engineers should uphold proper behavior and etiquette in software engineering and handling the hardware of customers.
- Software engineers should be confidential to their customers, take software development jobs that they know are within their skill range (Competence), be aware of laws in regards to copyright, and not misusing the hardware of client's computers. 

Association for Computing Machinery (ACM)/ Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) Code of Ethics
- These refer to the code of ethics software engineers should adhere to when developing software.

1. Public- Software engineers should always act in accordance to public interests.
2. Client and Employer- Software engineers should act with respect to clients and employers.
3. Product- Software engineers should create software applications of the highest caliber.
4. Judgement- independence.
5. Management- Software engineers should be more ethical in managing software development.
6. Profession- promote professionalism
7. Colleagues- Software engineers should be supportive to their colleagues.
8. Self- Software engineers should strive for lifelong learning
