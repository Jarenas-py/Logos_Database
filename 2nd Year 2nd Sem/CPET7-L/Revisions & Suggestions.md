REVISIONS and SUGGESTIONS as per advise of Ma'am Acoba:
1. Revision of Verilog and Altera Cyclone code and output. Outputs "LOW", "MID", "HIGH" ay dapat di nag correspond sa isang set of logic inputs (100 for Low, 110 for Mid, and 111 for High). She advised na sa lahat ng input possibilities ng 3-input Water Level indicator natin, dapat may correspounding output that is not 0 and is either low, mid, or high. As per the suggestions of Ma'am Acoba, the following inputs of the truth table should have the following output:

000 - No Output
001 - Low
010 - Low
011 - Mid
100 - Mid
101 - Mid
110- High
111- High

(Note: Show binary if Low, Mid and High)

2. "The truth table should defend the Altera Cyclone Output"
3. Formatting for Truth Table should be per segment given all 3-input possibilities.
4. Given the new revisions provided by Ma'am Acoba, the following sections of the paper will be revised as well:
a. Concept of Design.
b. Flow Chart
c.
