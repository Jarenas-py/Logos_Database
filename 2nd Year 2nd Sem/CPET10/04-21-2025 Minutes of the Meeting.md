Minutes of the Meeting- 04-21-2025

Agenda: Discuss idea overview of the supposed program of the approved topic in CPET10 (Multiprogramming- FCFS Non-preemptive Scheduling)

- The group discussed how to implement Multiprogramming FCFS into a programming. After inquiries with Ma'am Villafuerte and some deliberation by the group, it was clarified that a back-end + a front-end CLI will be utilized for the simulation of FCFS Scheduling.
- The grouped has agreed upon two plans:
	  1. Plan A: @Joseph will learn the C program simulating FCFS Non-Preemptive scheduling provided by Geek4Geeks and other resources as the back-end for the program of the group. This will then be handed over to @Jordan to formulate or come up with an idea for the front-end.
	  2. Plan B: @Lian , while Plan A is in effect, will create a back-end + front-end FCFS simulation program using AI tools.
- Further tasks will be distributed during or after the formulation of the program.
- Task distribution for the paper documentation of the program will be disseminated after the formulation of the program.
