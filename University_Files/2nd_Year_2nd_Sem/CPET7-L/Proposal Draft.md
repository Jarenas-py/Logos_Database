C. Title of the Project
Water Level Indicator

D. Project Description
The proposed Water Level Indicator will be a module that will utilize both VHDL and the Altera Cyclone FPGA IV in alerting users of the water level of a given container. Being a scaled down flood alert system, the proposed project aims to achieve the same functionality through water detection sensors, the inherent logic gates of the FPGA system and a VHDL program logic that mirrors the presumed function. 

To achieve the proposed functionality, a 3x3 circuit would be formulated. With the application of a water level sensor, a range of water volumes in unit milliliters (mL) preset by the circuit itself would serve as the determiner for the indicator output. Given a container comprising of rudimentary water volume content, a Green Light-Emitting Diode (LED) lndicator would receive current. Given a volume content that exceeds the "low" level but does not surpass the threshold of the water level sensor, an Orange LED would light up. A Red LED would draw current given that the volumetric water content of a given container reaches the threshold of the water level sensor.
