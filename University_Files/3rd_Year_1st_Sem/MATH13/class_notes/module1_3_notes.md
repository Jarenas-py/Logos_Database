- Population Size (N)- Refers to number of elements in a population 
- Parameter- Characteristics of a population
- Census- When parameters of a population are collected.

Ex. Given a quantitative variable weight of a feather, the measurement or value is 0.5 kg.

4 SCALES OF MEASUREMENT

1. NOMINAL SCALE- no order.
2. ORDINAL SCALE- Ranking, percentile, quartile. Gaps are not equal.
3. INTERVAL SCALE- ordered scale pero no "zero"
4. RATIO SCALE- ordered scale with true "zero."
