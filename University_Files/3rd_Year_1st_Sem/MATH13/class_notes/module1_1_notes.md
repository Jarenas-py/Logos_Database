IMPORTANCE OF ENGINEERING DATA ANALYSIS TO CPET STUDENTS

Note: Mayroon tayong tinatawag na OBE (Output Based Education). It is a type of learning methodology that is commonly utilized by educational institutions. Basically speaking, OBE is a goal oriented type of education. The instructor thinks of a goal that a student should achieve and bases the curriculum they will make from that end-goal. It is structured and time-bound. Ang kabaligtaran niya is CBE (Competency Based Education) which is more applicaple to Graduate Schools wherein students ang bahala sa time nila in an academic institution.

1. Foundation for Data-Driven Decision Making
2. Support for Emerging Technologies
3. Enhancement of Problem-Solving Skills

1. FOUNDATION FOR DATA-DRIVEN DECISION MAKING
- Computer Engineers with large quantities of data. Utilizing EDA can help these engineers interpret these large datas properly and make informed decisions from those using EDA.

- OBE Competency: Students are able to properly utilize software applications for statistical tools to analyze engineering datasets.
 
2. SUPPORT FOR EMERGING TECHNOLOGIES
- May mga emerging technologies that require vast amounts of data para lang magawa sila (e.g. Artifical intelligence and cybersecurity) kaya with the basic of EDA, CPET students would be able to design and maintain algorithms and systems sa mga emerging technologies na ito.

OBE Competency: Utilize EDA to create the aforementioned emerging technologies.

3. ENHANCEMENT OF PROBLEM-SOLVING SKILLS
- EDA teaches how to solve problems through the utilization of statistics. In the field of computer engineering, solving problems that are data-driven in essence are common that is why need ito.

- OBE Competency: Solve engineering problems (especially in the field of computer engineering) through various statistical methodologies.
