SAMPLING METHODS AND DATA COLLECTION METHODS

1. PROBABILITY SAMPLING
- simple random, systematic random, stratified and cluster

2. NON-PROBABILITY SAMPLING
- vonvenience, quota, purposive, snowball sampling

3. DATA COLLECTION METHODS
- survey, interview, experiment, observation

SAMPLING METHODS
1. PROBABILITY SAMPLING
- member of population is chosen entirely by chance or has equal chance.

A. Simple Random Sampling
- Draw lots or random numbers random kuha lang talaga.

B. Systematic Random Sampling
- Elements are selected on regular intervals. 
- Select kth element in a population where k=N/n with the starting point chosen at random

Example: 1500 population and sample size (n) is 300 then k=N/n or k=1500/300 which is 5. This means that rhe 5th person is acquired to be part of n.

NOTE: DON'T USE THIS ON ELEMENTS WITH TIME VARYING VARIABLES.

C. Stratified Random Sampling
- Divide population into non overlapping strata. By that it means you have groups that do not share any parameters/variables with each other.
- Afterwards, you take samples from wach geoup andcombine those acquired i to one a tual sample size 

Stratifide Equal Allocation- equal sample from each group.
- number of samples to get per group is as follows:
number=n/g (n is sample size and g is number of groups)

Stratified Proportional Allocation- proportional sa dami ng population ng group yung kukunin mong sample sakanila.
- Divide each group by N and multiply result by intended n.
- n= (Ni/N)n wherein Ni is the group size. Round up always

D. Cluster Sampling
- Divide subgroups into clusters then randomly select a sample of clusters. Then randomly choose elements inside the chosen cluster.

2. NON-PROBABILITY SAMPLING
- Biased or not equal chance of being picked in a sample.

A. Convenience Sampling
- Participants based on availability and willingness.

B. Quota Sampling
- Chosen based on the objective of a study or reaching a quota.

C. Purposive Sampling
- relies on the judgement of reaearcher on who to ask to participate based on purpose.

D. Snowball Sampling- For hard to reach group. Subjects are asked to find more subjects.

3. DATA COLLECTION METHODS
- Techniques for gathering data for research purposes.
- Surveys, ibterview, observation and experiment.

A. Survey- distributing questtionaires to large group of respondents. More close ended questions.

B. Interview- Can be structured (strict), semi-structured (script with a bit if foexibility), unstructured (open ended)

C. Observation- watch record stuff on a controlled setting. Can be participant or nob participant based.

D. Experiment- manipulate variables under controlled conditions to observe their effects.
