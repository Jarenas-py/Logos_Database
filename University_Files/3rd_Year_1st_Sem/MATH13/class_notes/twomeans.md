Hypothesis Testing of Two Means

- Between two grouped data and their means, you are testing your hypothesis based sa data gathered from those two groups. You confirm if your hypothesis is true based sa two groups through a statistical methodologies. 

Definition of Terms:
1. Null Hypothesis (Ho)- It is the status quo, the "nothing happens or changes" theory given a research topic. Halimbawa, your study is about finding the preferred IDE by 2nd year students, your null hypothesis is there is no preferred IDE. Basta Null Hypothesis is the theory of no change or presumption if nothing hence the name "null."

2. Alternative Hypothesis (Ha)- It is the researcher's actual hypothesis or theory given a research topic. You are making a presumption against the null hypothesis kumbaga. Going back to the earlier example, the Ha for that would be VSCode is the preferred IDE by 2nd year students.

3. Sample Size (n)- Limited group taken from a population.

4. Standard Deviation (σ)- How spread out data is with respect sa average/mean data. Lower SD= Lower spread. Higher SD= Larger spread. Halimbawa, the mean of a given grouped data is 50 tapos the scores were 51, 50, and 49. Mababa lang SD niya since malapit lang yung data sa mean. However, if the data set is 12, 100, 45, then the SD is high since malaki yung gap ng mga numbers from the data set.

Mayroon tayong Sample SD (s) and Population SD (σ). Both are self-explanatory. One mus take note that their absence or presence determine what hypothesis testing to use. This will be discussed further later.

5. Confidence Level
