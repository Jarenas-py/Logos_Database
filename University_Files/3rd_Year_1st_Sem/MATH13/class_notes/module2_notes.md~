n Grouped Data without class- Ilang beses umulit ang isang element sa isang grouped data

Frequency in Grouped Data with class- Indibidual elements are grouped and the freqeuency is then presented however, hindi mo na makikita frequency ng individual elements. Class Interval yung grouped elements and class frequencies naman yung respective frequencies nila. Ung nasa left hand side ng class interval is lower class interval and nasa right is higher class interval

Class boundary. Lower class interval -0.5, higher class interval +0.5. Then you get the class boundaries ex. 17.5-20.5 ganun. 17.5 is lower class boundary, 20.5 is higher class boundary. If class intervals mo ay 12.5-30.5 then -+0.05. If 12.56-30.56, then -+0.005 and so on and so forth.

Class Width- Difference of upper and lower class boundary. Pwede ring difference ng class intervals.

Class Mark- Median of class interval. Pwede rin gamitin median of class boundaries.

STEPS IN CONSTRUCTING FREQUENCY DISTRIBUTION

Given an unsorted groiped data, use the Sturges' formula. Round i to whole number
i= 1+ [(log n)/(log 2)]

n= sample size

Determine the Range- Highest-Lowest data.

Divide range to number of class interval to obtain class width.

c= range/i wherein c=class width.

List the lower class limit of the lowest clas sinterval then add class width.

List the upper class limit.

Tally the frequencies for each class interval and sum them up based on the ungrouped data.

Total

GENERATE FREQUENCY DISTRIBUTION USING EXCEL

Refer to one given by sir BobJog
Relative Frequency Rf= (frequency/total frequency)100

Less than cumulative frequency- Add mo lang frequency

Grereethan cumulative frequency- adding starting from the frequency of the last class limit then upwards.

Qualitative data is easier in tabular form since no need to create classes.

Frequency distribution is used for nominal and ordinal scales.

OTHER KINDS OF TABLES

Cross sectional data table- different elements of a population and their information on a certain period if time only

Time Series data table- Same sa cross sectional data table pero varying times naman.

Contingency Table- Matrix format that dislays frequency of several variables
