GRADE COMPUTATION
where in: 
G= Grade
RS= Real Score
PS= Perfect Score

G= [(RS/PS)(50)]+50

Note: In computation of the final grade one must refer to the total score of the student given a certain component (Attendance, Activites, Performance Task, etc.) then multiply it to the percentage of that component to the score. For example, after totaling the final grade of the Attendance component using the grade computation formula and they got 86 and the percentage for attendance is 10%, then 86 * 0.1 would be the way to find the final grade of the Attendance component of the student.
