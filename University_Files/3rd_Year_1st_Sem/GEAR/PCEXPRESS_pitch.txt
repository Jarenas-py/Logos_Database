"A ruler is not born, but made. Shaped by trials, sharpened by loss, strengthened by duty." This is a quote by the sovereign ruler Emhyr var Emreis from Witcher 3. He states that sovereignty is a state of valiant duty and relentless determination. Lim Ulsan Soo-Hoon, Team Liquid PH, EDG, these are some of the names that have taken the mantle as "sovereign" on their respective games. And for this year, TUP-Manila's GEAR aims to hold the crown and share the glory as it takes the throne to host Ascend: Sovereign.

As you may all know, TUP GEAR hosts "Ascend," an annual major event that showcases the capabilities of our talented students which is also celebrated in conjunction with the university's founding anniversary. GEAR had faced countless tribulations, from Cybersynth, to reaching for the stars through Hyperdrive. Now, GEAR yearns for a throne to rule them all. To share its glory with everyone as it celebrates Ascend: Sovereign. A turning point milestone celebration that desires to be the epitome of sovereignty. Unveiling and inspiring students around all university campuses on what it means to rest on the zenith.


As GEAR rises to sovereignty, it is only natural that grand arenas rise. For sovereignty is not only worn as a crown, but displayed in the crucible of conpetition. Thus, the overture to our major and minor tournaments are unveiled. Ascend: Sovereign's vision is to tread forward along with the momentum it has gained from Ascend: Hyperdrive. One of the more significant aspects of our event are our tournament runs which are held on campus and also livestreamed on our Facebook Page. Along with this, our tournament runs are also recorded and posted on our Youtube Channel, further extending the reach of our event to various platforms. Included as our major tournaments are mobile legends, teamfight tactics, and valorant. Being mainstream and accessible games in the locale, not only do these games enable accessibility to our tiurnament participants, these tournament runs would also be a huge opportunity to garner a large audience because of their respective reputation in the Philippines. To add with that, we also have minor games such as Tekken 8 and Honor of Kings. We have adapted these as our minor games because of their rising popularity in the Philippines with Honor of Kings rising as the number one MOBA at its launch on ios and google play store and tekken 8 being the most premier and well-known fighting game to date. Apart from our tournament runs, GEAR presents another crown on its domain where fabric becomes armor, myth to reality, our cosplay competition.
(add furhter info).

Going back to our major and minor tournament runs, the following would be the bracket progression system of the participants which would be straightforward so allow me to keep it brief. Do take note that this applies to all aforementioned game titles excluding team fight tactics.

We have the qualifiers stage where players from all TUP campus participants battle it out on a single elimination format. Taking the top 3 from the Manila campus and 1 of each other campus, we then progress to the play-ins stage.

The fight for the crown would never be easy and with that, the play ins stage becomes a testament to the trials the participants will have to go through in their pursuit for sovereignty. This will be held in double elims format with the top 6 progressing to the play offs stage and the 2 temas with the most wins advancing immediately to the semi finals.

With the crown being within reach, the play offs becomes a battle of natural selection. With the six teams duking it out for a spot in the semi finals, and the previous 2 teams from the play ins figthing for survival will be fought in a best of 1 format, with the finals being fought on a best of 3 with the winner being proclaimed this year's ascend champion.

As for teamfight tactics, a leaderpoint system with the most points determining a player's standing among others on the competition would be utilized.

As stated earlier, our major tournament runs would be held on campus as it is livestreamed on ihr official facebook platform.  With that, the following floor plan for the on-campus Ascend event is as follows. (EXPLAIN WHAT YOU SEE)

Our dear sponsor would be placed here on the tail of our venue for easy access by both viewers and students in the event. Rest assured that during the event, designated personnel from our organization would be present to assist you and your needs.

The Facebook impression figures from our last Ascend: Hyperdrive speak volumes about the event’s reach. Among the highlights were the opening teaser, which drew remarkable engagement, the “Happening Now” announcement, which generated strong real-time traction, and the tournament finals, which captured peak audience attention. These key moments alone demonstrate the significant visibility and value that our sponsors received through their partnership.

For this year’s Ascend: Sovereign, we are determined to surpass those milestones. With the arrival of a fresh wave of students entering the university, we anticipate even greater public exposure—expanding both our audience base and the impact we can deliver to our partners.


The following are the various engagement statistics that TUP GEAR holds to its different social media platforms. Comparing these to the the previous Ascend:Hyperdrive numbers, these statistics have all acquired a net gain with our X platform  and TikTok account seeing a significant increase in follower count of 12% and 23% in gains respectively and a 5% increase in follower count for our facebook page ever since the previous event. It is project med that these rates would increase especially with the influx of new student freshmen in the various campuses of TUP. 

In addition, our current organization has 100 officers and 210 members strong which help nurture the organization's objectives. Moreover, as an organization that also collaborates with other of the university's campuses, the machinations of TUP GEAR reaches to those campuses as well which has an approximate number of 116k students.

TUP GEAR values its current partnership with PC Express and we are happy that you have agreed to sponsor us various essentials for our on campus events especially on our tournament runs. 

For sponsor packages, certain contributions would unlock to respective tiers. These packages would render various exposure options depending on the package   acquired. Do take note that sponsor packages can be also applied to the value of contributed equipment. 

Thanks to the very generous contributions of PC Express, the highest sponsor package has been bestowed upon them. The Co founder sponsor package enables much as exposure of the company to the various publication materials and live stream exposure during the totality of Ascend: Sovereign. Significant privileges included booth setup on event, acknowledgement as co presentor of the event during, at the beginning and end of streams, option to disemminate survey on attendees and among others.

TUP GEAR has established itself as a leader in collegiate esports, earning Broadcast Production of the Year and Tournament of the Year in 2021, back-to-back School Spirit Awards in 2022, and recognition as Best Alliance Organization and Outstanding Alliance Organization – Metro West in 2024. These achievements showcase our proven track record of excellence, credibility, and strong community engagement—making this Ascend a high-value platform for sponsors.

Due to the success of our Ascend events, different companies and organizations were inclined to sponsor our events.

Their support has not only fueled our growth, but also solidified our sovereignty in the collegiate esports realm.

and so, we close with a quote by Aldia, the first scholar of sin from dark souls 2. "Many monarchs have come and gone. One drowned in poison, another succumbed to flame. Still another slumbers in a realm of ice. Not one of them stood here, as you do now. You, conqueror of adversities. Give us your answer. Will you further share in our pursuit for sovereignty?"
