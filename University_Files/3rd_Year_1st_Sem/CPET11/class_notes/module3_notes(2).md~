SUPPORT CIRCUIT DESIGN 1

SUPPORT CIRCUIT DESIGNS
- Electro-mechanical circuits na usually sinasama sa mga microcontrollers para mas gumanda performance of the latter. In the context of this lesson, regulated power supply yung support circuit design na ididiscuss.

DEFINITION OF TERMS
1. Voltage- Also known as electromotive force. It is the push that lets the electrons flow inside a given circuit. Measured in volts.
2. Current- It is the amount of electrons flowing given a circuit. Measured in amps.
3. Resistance- It is an element that constricts or opposes the flow of electrons in a circuit. Measured in ohms.
4. Power- How much work the electrons are doing in a given circuit. Measured in watts.

BASIC OHM'S LAW FORMULA
1. V= IR ; where in V= Voltage, I= current, and R= Resistance
2. I= V/R
3. R= V/I
4. P= VI ; wherein P= Power in watts
5. P= I^2R
6. P= V^2R

REGULATED POWER SUPPLY
- Direct current support circuit design that provides a stable source of power given a MCU.

OVERVIEW OF DC REGULATED POWER SUPPLY
- AC Source -> Transformer -> Rectifier -> Filter -> IC Regulator -> Load
