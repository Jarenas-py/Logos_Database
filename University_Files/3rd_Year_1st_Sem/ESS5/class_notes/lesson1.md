FOUNDATION OF ENGINEERING ECONOMY

WHAT IS ENGINEERING ECONOMY?
- Simplify comparing alternatives based on economical feasibility for engineering decision making.

DIFFERENCE OF ENGINEERING ECONOMY AND ECONOMICS

Engineering Economy
- Interest, Future worth, discount, annual worth analysis, cost benefit analysis, breakeven, payback analysis.

Economics
- Law of supply and demand, law of diminishing return, macroeconomics, GDP, elasticity of demand, revenues.

WHY IS ENGINEERING ECONOMY IMPORTANT?
- Engineers design and create and that involves economic decisions. Valuing the money and the economic equivalence of this designs are vital for cost effectiveness of projects.

BASIC TERMINOLOGIES IN ENGINEERING ECONOMY
1. Alternatives- Stand alone solution for a given solution. Basically yung mga iba't-ibang options mo hence the term alternatives.
2. Cash Flows- estimated in and out flows of money.
3. Alternative Selection- Dapat a given situation has two alternatives.
4. Do Nothing (DN) Alternative- Also known as Status Quo alternative meaning given a situation, you do not do anything in the mean time. 
5. Evaluation Criteria- Identifying the best alternative based on economic aspects.
6. Intangible Factors- External and unexpected factors that affect decision making of alternative.
7. Time Value of Money (TVM)- Change of value of money over time. 

VALUE VS AMOUNT
- Self explanatory.

RATIONAL DECISION-MAKING PROCESS
1. Recognize a Decision Problem
2. Define goals or objectives.
3. Collect all relevant information
4. Identify alternatives.
5. Select evaluation criteria.
6. Select best alternative.

ROLE OF ENGINEERS IN BUSINESS
- Create & Design
- Analyze
- Evaluate

PREDICTING THE FUTURE
- Estimating and forecasting sustainability and demand given a product.
- Time and uncertainty are factors when it comes to this. 

FUNDAMENTAL PRINCIPLES OF ENGINEERING ECONOMICS
1. An instant dollar is worth more than a distant dollar.
2. All it counts is the differences among alternatives.
3. Marginal revenue must exceed marginal cost. When you say marginal revenue, it is the additional income a business gains from a product. Marginal cost naman is additional expense incurred by a product hence the third principle.
4. Additional Risk is not taken without expected additional return.
