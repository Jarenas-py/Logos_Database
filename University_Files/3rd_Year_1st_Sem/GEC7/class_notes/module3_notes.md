SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY IN THE 19TH CENTURY

SCIENCE BECOMES PROFESSIONAL
- Scinece becomes a profession and intitutionalized as a career.

SCIENTIFIC INSTITUTIONS

UNIVERSITIES
- University of Berlin- inteoduced humboldtian model or teaching + research in learning)
- John Hopkins University- developed the PHD system
- Cornell University- Blended practical education with classical and scientific studies. 

ACADEMIES
- US Military Academy- nations first academically rrained engineers
- Warrenton Academy

SOCIETIES
- Industrial eevolution, rise of factories
- Urbanization (Check previous notes). May social classes being the Aristrocrats, Bourgeoisie and Proletariat.

GOVERNMENT AND INDUSTRY SUPPORT FOR SCIENCE


GOVERNMENT SUPPORT
- many european governments began to allocate funds for research and development as it directly affects military power and industrial and economy growth.

STATE SPONSORED INSTITUTIONS
- establishment of observatories, geological institutiks , and research laboratories. 

PUBLIC HEALTH AND INFRASTRUCTURE
- governments invested on sanitation, water supply and disease prevention. 

INDUSTRY SUPPORT 

INDUSTRIAL REVOLUTION DEMAND
PRIVATE LABORATORIES- start of R&D
ENGINEERING AND APPLIED SCIENCES- railroads, steel production and electrical sciences. 

IMPACT OF SUPPORT

Professionalization of Science- Self explanatory

INNOVATION AND ECONOMIC GROWTH- government + industry investments accelerated discoveries in medicine and engineering tech.

INSTITUTIONALIZATION OF RESEARCH- developed the growing development of institutions of universities and scientific societies. 

SPECIALIZED FIELDS OF SCIENCE IN THE 19TH CENTURY

NATURAL SCIENCE
- made up of different branches of fundamental science. 
- Biology
- Chemistry
- Physics
- Earth Science
- Astronomy


ENGINEERING AND TECHNOLOGY
- Technology- refers to th
- Engineering
- Mechanical
- Chemical and Process Engineering
- Geomatics Engineering

MEDICAL AND HEALTH SCIENCES
- Anatomy
- Cardiology
- Genetics
- Medicine
- Nutrition
- Psychiatry

AGRICULTURAL SCIENCES
- self exanatory

SOCIAL SCIENCE
- philosophy
- politics- principles and strategies on actual governmental bodies
- Economics
- Sociology- how people interact with each other. 

SCIENTIST AS A PROFESSION

SCIENTIST- follow systematic process called the scientific method. 

WHAT DOES SCIENTIEST DO?
- They ask question kn the world around them
 They create new technologies thay are useful to humanity and to solve past and present problems.

PROFESSIONAL SCIENTIEST
requirement:
1. Formal education
2. Work in universities and research institutions
3. Recieve funding through grants and institutions
4. Publish in lerr reviewed journals 
5. Follow ethical codes and standardized scientific methods.
6. Aim to advance knowledge and solve problems

AMATEUR SCIENTIST
- motivated by curioaity and passion. Often self taught. Work independently as part of citizen science projects. 
- May lack access to funds and advanced tools

SCIENTIFIC COMMUNICATION (JOURNALS, CONFERENCE)
- professionalization if science. made journals and organized scientific conferences to be standardized and broadened communication. 
- Science became structured, public, and professional. 

PHILOSOPHICAL BASIS OF THE 19TH CENTURY
- 19 th century had rapid innovation of technology. 

POSITIVISM ( AUGUSTE COMTE)
- august Comte- french philosopher and father of positivism. 
- philosophical ideology that aims to say na true knowledge only comes from scientific methods.

CHARACTERISTICS OF POSITIVISM
1. Science is the only valid knowledge
2. Fact is the object if knowledge
3. Task of Pholosophy is to find principles and it denies intuition.

LAW OF THREE STAGES
1. Theological Stage- Phenomena and supernatural or divinve causes are explained using such.

2. Metaphysical stage- Events are explained through abstract and philosophical concepts and speculation.

3. Positive Stage- Grounded in ibservation and experimentation.

MATERIALISM AND DETERMINISM
- Materialism- Everything that exists is material. As long is it does not have a soul then it is a material.

IMPACT- Supported darwins theiry kf evolution
- Karl Marx (dialectical materialism)

Determinism- Every event and future is determined.
- Newtonian mechanics is influenced by this. Newton believed that the universe follows mathematical rules and the laplace demon through experiment tells us that we could predict the future events of the univers

WHY DOES MATERIALISM AND DETERMINISM GO WELL TOGETHER

materialism how i am made and determinism how reality operates and it seeved biology, physiology and other branches of science

CHALLENGES
- challenged dualism and it contradicted it. 

SCIENCE AND RELIGION DEBATES
- Revolves ariund faith and science and how to exolain reality.

Religion- Aquinas believed that religion should be applied within religion and not overlap with science

Science- natural philosophy

RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE TWO
- discussions about philosophy natural world and theology

OBJECTIVITY AND PROGRESS
- objectuvity- science mustbe free from bias and emotions. 
- scientists sought to standardize measurements
- Portray nature as it truly is through standard forma of measurements.

- Progress- science advances over time, producing ever more accurate. 19th century showed visible benefits to scientific work.
- science is cumulative. Evolutionary theories tells us that as life evolves, science and technology ecolves as well.
