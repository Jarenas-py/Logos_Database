   2a. Engineering Management
   3a. Management and Its Process

Engineering Management
- It is the combination of of economic-based and engineering-focused management of a given company. (Rice University, 2022)
- Engineers are brought to the drawing board as majority of companies and business ventures are data-driven as of late. Engineering Management aids in translating massive statistical information that would help a company decide well thought of engineering and economic decisions for the benefit of their company. (Rice University, 2022)
- Fundamentally, engineering management tackles technical engineering combined with economic and administrative management. Safety of a project, sustainability and resource allocation, team building and product development that will give the company a financial edge are such concepts that are present in the aforementioned field. (Rice University, 2022)
- Engineering Management requires a combination of "soft" and "hard" skills (Edology, n.d.).

Importance of Engineering Management 
1. Acts as the bridge between the engineering and economic aspect of a project.
2. Technical ideas are implemented properly while still being able to actualize project and organizational goals.
3. Innovation of an engineering project is channeled in an effective and SUSTAINABLE manner. 

Management Skills Required of the Engineer
- Formally, one of the qualifications for being an Engineer Manager is acquiring a Masters of Science in Engineering Management or Manufacturing Engineering and Management (Edology, n.d.).
- As for the actual management skills required of an engineer, according to a web article by the University of San Diego, there are 11 engineering manager skills that were proposed in order for the engineer in question achieve success:

1. Problem-Solving
2. Project Management
3. Leadership
4. Decision-making
5. Communication
6. Technical
7. Delegation
8. Interpersonal
9. Strategic Thinking
10. Giving Constructive Feedback
11. Responsibility

(University of San Diego, n.d.)   

Functions of an Engineering Manager and Its Process
-Do take note that the functions of an engineer manager as well as the process for management both utilizes POLC. With that, POLC would be the respective subject for both aforementioned sub-topics.
- POLC (Planning, Organizing, Leading, Controlling) Framework- highly utilized methodologyfor carrying out day-to-day organizational operations (Lumen Learning, n.d.).

A. Planning
- Setting objectives.
- Involves observing the current market situation to determine, as well as predict, economic conditions.
- Identify best course of action based on current economic and market landscape.
- Evaluate the success of the proposed subject and think of contingencies for the sustainability of the said project.

   A1. Types of Planning
   a. Strategic Planning- Utilization of the SWOT (Strength, Weakness, Opportunities, and Threats) during the planning stage.
   b. Tactical Planning- Concrete plans such as policies and rules are that will help implement strategic plans are put into place.
   c. Operational Planning- Formulation of organization-wide goals and objectives with methods that would help achieve them. (Dito papasok ang mission and vision).

B. Organizing 
- Part of organizational and engineering management that develops the actual organizational structure and hierarchy of a given company as well as hiring of human resources that will help achieve the plans set forth during the operational stages of planning. 
- Also involves the formulation of actual jobs necessary for a project in an engineering organization.- Organizing ang engineering organization also refers to clustering these aforementioned jobs into clusters or "departments" in order to achieve for effective coordination and streamlined workflow.

C. Leading
- Refers to the positive influence to human resources in order to inspire action. 

D. Controlling
- Enfocement of organization-wide policies and rules to sustain organization goals and continuously hit company standards. According to an online course by Lumen Learning entitled, "Principles of Management," there are three steps in this specific framework:

   D1. Steps in Controlling Element
   a. Establishing Performance Standards
   b. Comparing Actual Performance Against Standards
   c. Taking corrective action only if necessary.

- Controlling is an essential element of the POLC framework since it is the element that secures the sustainability of an organization's goals.
