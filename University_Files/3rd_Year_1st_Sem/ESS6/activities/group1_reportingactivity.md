End of Reporting Activity

I. Instruction: Answer "APPROVED" if the statement is True. If otherwise, answer "REJECTED."

1. Engineering Management is the marriage of technical engineering and economic/administrative management. (APPROVED)

2. An Engineering Manager needs only “hard skills” like technical knowledge; soft skills aren’t important. (REJECTED)

3. One importance of Engineering Management is that it ensures technical ideas still align with organizational goals. (APPROVED)

4. Organizing involves building company structure, assigning jobs, and grouping them into departments. (APPROVED)

5. The Controlling stage in POLC always requires immediate punishment when performance is below standard. (REJECTED)

II. Instruction: The following are situations that an Engineer Manager might face. Answer "Hired!" if the situation is something an Engineer Manager should do in the situation. Answer "Fired!" if 
otherwise

1. Your company is about to launch a new water filtration system. Before production begins, you conduct a SWOT analysis to identify possible risks, competitors, and market opportunities. (Hired!)

2. Your design team reports a major flaw in the prototype of an electronic device. Instead of listening, you dismiss their input, insisting that only your opinion matters since you’re the “manager.” (Fired!)

3. A large infrastructure project is assigned to your company. You divide the work into departments—design, quality assurance, safety, and logistics—to make coordination smoother. (Hired!)

4. Deadlines are piling up and your team is stressed. You hold a short meeting to encourage them, recognize their hard work, and provide constructive feedback to keep morale high. (Hired!)

5. You’re monitoring the performance of a new automated assembly line. The results meet the performance standards perfectly. Despite this, you enforce unnecessary changes “just to shake things up.” (Fired!)

III. Reflection Question
As our professor has taught us before, Engineering Management does not only apply to the 
engineering industry specifically. It applies to all aspects of life. Give an instance during a
group work wherein you identified a flaw from the group leader's actions. State the things you
would have done differently if you were the leader while applying what you have learned today.

Note to Leader I: Instead of an end-of-the-presentation activity, pwede rin natin itong iintegrate during the middle of our report (except sa reflection question). Afterwards, pwede natin sila bigyan ng prize na related sa pagiging engineer manager.

1. Coffee Packets (Fuel for the future engineer manager)
2. Sticky Notes (Kasi engineering managers should organize the stuff needed to be done)
(Although gets ko naman if hindi feasible since may bayarins pa from other subjects. Suggestion lang naman)

Note to Leader II: As for the reflection question, naisip ko na habang may nagkkwento sa POLC, pwede natin ipasok itong reflection question na kung saan nagkaroon tayo ng problema as a group (kasi usually tayo naman ang magkaka-grupo) tapos doon natin siya i-act out sa harap then continue the reporting afterwards.
